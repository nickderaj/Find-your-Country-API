## Description

Using external APIs, find the country you're staying in with the click of a button as well as displaying your closest neighbour. <br>
First API: https://geocode.xyz/<br>
Second API: https://restcountries.eu/

## Usage Information

All you have to do is click the button and your country information should show up. The API is not the most accurate so some errors do occur (for example India shows us as British India), but this was just to test the functionality of multiple APIs at once.
